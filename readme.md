This R script calculates the intraclass correlation coefficient (icc)
This script contributed to the Fairless et al 2011 paper
Fairless et al 2011, doi: 10.1002/ar.21318, PMID: 21905241, PMCID: PMC3176979

The fictional data in "altereddata.txt" were modified from the original 
empirical data used in Fairless et al 2011.
I am using fictional data instead of the original data because I do not have 
permission of my co-authors to release the data into the public domain.  
Each row is a separate mouse/scoring period
Each column is a different method or rater for scoring social sniffing time by the mouse
